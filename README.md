## Description

Jam is a web application created to connect musicians who are interested in meeting up to play music.  This app is analogous to a bulletin board in which users can post about what events are happening.  Jam events provide details about the event like musical style, time, location, and who is the host.  Once logged in, the user is at the main board page which displays all the jam events that are going to happen, and if a user finds one interesting and wants to eventually attend the event, they can click "Interested?" and the jam will be saved in their account to be referenced later.  Any user can host a jam, and all jams hosted by each user are stored in their account.  This simple user interface allows musicians to look through jams, find what interests them, and keep track of valuable information regarding their musical meetups.
